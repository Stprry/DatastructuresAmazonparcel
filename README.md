The best approach to use in here
Extra marks for efficiency and explaining how



Generate packages with Postcode, Weight, Recipient name (10-20)

Sort packages based on postcode, this will do done via sorting the first 4 letters and number combination ( unsure on how this will work) - convert letters to ASCII to group them

From there sorting  them in to set groups I.e when the first two letters dont match that is one group ect ect until there are no groups left

Then sort the parcels by weight, this would be done with the heaviest at the bottom ( to make sure they don’t get crushed) 

Then that’s it they get loaded onto van?
